debug all
=========

This uses Cydia Substrate to make all processes debuggable. Shamelessly ripped off this MWR post:

[Debug All the Android Things] (https://labs.mwrinfosecurity.com/blog/2013/11/29/debug-all-the-android-things/)

Wrote this quickly onsite and threw it up here for future reference, first time playing with java so don't expect it to be pretty.....
